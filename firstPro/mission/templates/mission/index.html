<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
        <hr>
        <p> Course scheduling is a problem faced by many in the educational arena. People are overwhelmed what exactly would be a good course schedule. They do not have straightforward information about workload, homework difficulty, and compatible of classes. This is where come in. We are trying to create a schedule compiler that can help people to find a good synergy between their classes. We know from experience that creating a plan can be very stressful, and when one finds their schedule was poorly done it is too late to change it. Taking Intro to C and Intro to Java at the same time might seem like a good idea, but now you are confusing their libraries and their function calls. What we provide is a conglomerate of peoples experiences on these classes so that you do not make the same mistakes that others have. We also help you to make the good decisions that others have made. Students are stressed as it is, and do not need more things to stress over, so the more that we can relieve that stress, the better.
